Symptoms:
Master Cylinder - Leaking fluid (soft or no brake pedal).
Power Booster/Master Cylinder Connection - You may hear a
hissing noise.
Causes:
• Internal leak (Failed Seals)
• O-ring between the Master Cylinder and the Power Booster
• Air in the braking system
The Solution:
Remove and Replace the Master Cylinder if necessary. Make
sure the Power Booster is working at full potential and check
the O-ring and brake system (hoses/fittings for any signs of
wear), replace as necessary. When you are done checking the
system, bleed the system to get all the air or moisture out.

O-ring

GM Master Cylinder

If you notice a difference in the resistance of the brake pedal it’s a sign you need immediate service.
Some owners of select GM vehicles may comment on a low brake pedal during
braking. This may be caused by a master cylinder and or the brake booster,
there is an O-ring between the master cylinder and the brake booster along
with the internal seals of the master cylinder that may have deteriorated
because of age or contamination. Inspect for the O-ring before performing
any other diagnostics. Replace the O-ring if missing or damaged.
Tip: The booster vacuum may have to be purged by either pumping the brake
pedal a few times or pulling the check-valve out prior to removing the master
cylinder, at this point make sure when you dislodge the master cylinder from
the power booster that you check for the O- ring being dislodged by the
suction.
Tip: When installing a replacement master cylinder, make sure the O-ring is in
the right place.

Leaking Fluid - If you’re experiencing a soft brake pedal, have a technician
look for:
• Fluid leaks around the master cylinder (usually an internal leak)
• Brake fluid bypassing internal seals
• Check connections to the master cylinder and the brake system
If you’re a DIY individual, you can do the inspection of the master cylinder and
surrounding brake area.
Spongy or no Brake Pedal - If you notice a difference in the resistance of the
brake pedal (it feels softer or sinks all the way to the floor when you press on
it), it’s a sign you need immediate service. There could be air or moisture in
the braking system, or a problem with the master cylinder.
Hissing Noise at the Master Cylinder/Booster - If you hear hissing or air
escaping (vacuum leak) between the master cylinder and the booster, inspect
the O-ring to see if it’s missing or damaged in any way. If it is missing or
damaged, replace it.
