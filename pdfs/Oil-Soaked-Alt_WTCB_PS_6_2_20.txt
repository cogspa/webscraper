		Application: 1997-2004 Mitsubishi
		
Montero/Montero Sport with V-6 Engine
Symptom:
Repeat alternator failure.
Cause:
Oil leaking from the front, passenger camshaft seal
side. The oil is drawn through the alternator as the
vehicle is running, causing premature failure.
The Solution:
This alternator comes with a specially designed oil drip
guard, but steps should be taken to repair the oil leak.

Repeat alternator failure is not the fault of the alternator,
and may be the result of an oil leak.
When a Mistsubishi Montero, or Montero Sport with a V-6 engine, from the years
1997-2004 suffers from a charging system failure, the problem may be caused
by an oil-soaked alternator.

In an effort to address this problem,
MPA engineers developed a fitted,
oil-drip guard for the alternator.

A leaking valve cover gasket, camshaft
seal, a power steering pump, or power
steering hose will contaminate the
alternator with oil causing it to short out
and fail.

This guard will help prolong the life
of the alternator, but this is not a cure
and the leak will need to be fixed.

The oil is drawn through the alternator
as the vehicle is running, causing the
premature failure.

Drip guard engineered by MPA.

Replace the camshaft seal(s) as necessary. If the camshaft seals leak, the
timing belt may need to be replaced as well.
