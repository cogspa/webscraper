Winter Preparedness

Master Cylinder Winter Checklist


CHECK THE LEVEL OF BRAKE FLUID.



TAKE NOTE OF THE LEVEL OF FLUID IN THE MASTER CYLINDER. IF THE BRAKE FLUID
IS BELOW THE LOW MARK IN THE RESERVOIR, THIS COULD BE AN INDICATION OF A
LEAK IN THE BRAKING SYSTEM. HAVE THIS ISSUE LOOKED AT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
TO RECTIFY ANY PROBLEMS.



CHECK YOUR OTHER FLUIDS. BRAKE FLUID IS ONE OF THE SIX FLUIDS YOU CHECK
EVERY MONTH AND ESPECIALLY DURING THE WINTER. THE OTHER FLUIDS ARE
ENGINE OIL, TRANSMISSION FLUID IF YOU DRIVE A VEHICLE WITH AN AUTOMATIC
TRANSMISSION, ANTIFREEZE/COOLANT, POWER STEERING FLUID, WINDSHIELD
WASHER FLUID.



CHANGE YOUR BRAKE FLUID IF NECESSARY. UNLIKE ENGINE OIL, BRAKE FLUID WILL
LAST MUCH LONGER. HOWEVER, SOME VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS DO RECOMMEND
CHANGING THE BRAKE FLUID EVERY 2 TO 3 YEARS (24,000 TO 36,000 MILES). BRAKE
FLUID WILL DETERIORATE OVER TIME AS IT BECOMES DIRTY, ABSORBS MOISTURE,
AND THE CORROSION INHIBITORS IN THE BRAKE FLUID WEAR OUT.



MAKE SURE TO FLUSH YOUR BRAKE FLUID WHENEVER ANY BRAKE SYSTEM
HYDRAULIC REPAIRS ARE PERFORMED. FLUSHING THE BRAKE SYSTEM WITH NEW
BRAKE FLUID WILL HELP OPTIMIZE BRAKE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE, IMPROVE
BRAKE COMPONENT RELIABILITY, AND WILL HELP TO ENSURE SAFE BRAKE SYSTEM
OPERATION.



A SOFT/SPONGY BRAKE PEDAL OR LOW BRAKE FLUID LEVEL COULD INDICATE LEAKS
IN THE BRAKE SYSTEM. CHECK THE MASTER CYLINDER FOR ANY FLUID LEAKAGE
AROUND OR UNDERNEATH THE MASTER CYLINDER AND ESPECIALLY WHERE IT
CONNECTS TO THE POWER BOOSTER. REPLACE THE MASTER CYLINDER IF YOU SEE
ANY LEAKS.



IT IS A GOOD PRACTICE TO HAVE A COMPLETE INSPECTION AND ANY NEEDED
REPAIRS COMPLETED ON YOUR VEHICLE’S BRAKE SYSTEM BEFORE WINTER
WEATHER SETS IN TO HELP ENSURE SAFE, OPTIMUM BRAKE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE
DURING THE UPCOMING MONTHS.

NOTE: REPLACE THE BRAKE FLUID WITH THE VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS’ RECOMMENDED BRAKE FLUID TYPE.
