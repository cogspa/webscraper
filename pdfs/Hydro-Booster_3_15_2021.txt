DO NOT attempt to repair a faulty Hydro-booster, it must be replaced.
Hard Pedal (At Idle):
A hard pedal can result from fluid contamination and binding of the
brake pedal linkage, or the hydro-boost unit can be failing.
High Pedal/Excessive Steering Effort:
The power steering pump drive belt could be loose or worn, the power
steering fluid level may be low, or the engine may be idling too low.
Note that there may also be restrictions in the hydraulic lines or a
possible failed power steering pump.
Slow Pedal Return:
A slow pedal return may be attributed to binding brake pedal linkage,
restrictions in the hydraulic lines, or the hydro-booster’s possible
internal failure.

Pulsating Pedal:
Pulsation/chatter at the pedal may be caused by a loose or slipping
drive belt. This condition may also be due to low power steering fluid,
a defective or failed power steering pump, or the hydro-booster’s
possible internal failure.
Sensitive Brakes:
The binding of the brake pedal linkage or possible failure of the hydrobooster may cause sensitive brakes.
Excessive Noise:
A noisy hydro-booster may indicate low power steering fluid, air in the
system, a loose or slipping drive belt, or restrictions in the hydraulic
lines. Noise may also come from a defective power steering pump or
pulley.
Note: It is crucial to flush the power steering system and replace any necessary filters
before replacing a failed hydro-boost unit.
