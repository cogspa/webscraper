Application: All vehicles with Brake Calipers
COMMON LUBRICATION POINTS
Symptom:
• Brake noise-squeak/squeal
• Uneven brake pad wear
Cause:
• Bare metal to metal contact of components
• Inability of the caliper to move freely
(Floating-Sliding Calipers)
• Inability of the disc pads to move freely in the caliper
bracket or the anchor plate
Solution:
Proper lubrication allows the pads and caliper to move and
function as designed. As an added benefit, it has proven to
help reduce noise, a critical metric.

LUBRICATION: CALIPER ASSEMBLY
Always use Lubricant specifically designated for Disc Brake
Systems AND NOT...
Petroleum-based products - Petroleum products can cause
rubber components (seals) to swell and fail, leading to potential
brake failure and system contamination.
Molybdenum Disulfide (Moly) - Moly products are excellent
when applied to metal surfaces but do not work well with rubber.
Depending upon the carrier (petroleum), they can react with
rubber the same as petroleum products.

Silicon - Silicon greases are generally suitable for non-metal
components because they do not react with them (resist
swelling). They are not the best choice for metal surfaces due to
their lower pressure capabilities.
Anti-seize Compounds - These can be excellent for preventing
galling, seizing, and corrosion. They are widely used on fasteners
to prevent a galvanic reaction. They are not designed to be a
lubricant, especially a brake lubricant.
Axle or Chassis Grease - Low-quality greases do not have a
wide temperature range, cannot withstand washout, and lose
some lubricating properties over time. High pressure and anticorrosive properties are also lacking.
