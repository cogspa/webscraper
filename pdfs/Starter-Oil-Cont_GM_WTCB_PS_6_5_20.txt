Application: 1990-2008 GM Vehicles
with 4 cylinder and V6 engines
Symptom:
Repeat starter failure, no start condition, no crank condition,
or intermittent no start condition.
Oil Covered Starter

Cause:
Oil, or other fluid, leaking from the engine.
The Solution:
Repair the leaks causing oil, or other fluids to drip onto
the starter.
Replacement Starter

Failure to repair these fluid leaks will cause premature
failure of the replacement starter
If your 1990-2008 GM vehicle has a 4 cylinder, or V6 engine and is suffering from one or
more of the symptoms listed above, it may be caused by oil or other fluids leaking from
the engine. After removing the starter from the vehicle, carefully inspect for evidence
of oil, or other fluids on the starter which will indicate engine leaks. Failure to repair
these fluid leaks will cause contamination of the starter internal components, causing
premature failure of the replacement starter.
When replacing the starter don’t just inspect the starter, carefully inspect the mounting
surfaces on the engine and transmission for signs of fluids, rust, or corrosion. This must
be cleaned before installing the replacement starter to insure good ground continuity.
Finally, check all the fuses in this application. The “S” terminal wire is fused and if it gets
shorted out, you need to back track this wire into the fuse block to check that specific
fuse. Don’t forget to also check the battery to make sure it is fully charged and has 12.60
volt or higher state of charge.
