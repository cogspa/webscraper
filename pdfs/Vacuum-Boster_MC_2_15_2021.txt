		Application: Vehicles equipped with vacuum booster 		
				 assemblies.

Symptom:
Hard Brake Pedal, vehicle requires excessive pedal
effort to stop. Failed Vacuum Brake Booster.

Fluid Leaking From Master Cylinder

Cause:
A leaking Master Cylinder Rear Piston Seal can allow
Brake Fluid to leak into the Brake Booster, causing it
to fail.
The Solution:
Replace both master cylinder and vacuum booster unit.

Damaged Booster

A Master Cylinder Brake Fluid leak can cause Vacuum Brake Booster failure.
Often, one part failure can be linked to another. In this case, the
vacuum booster and master cylinder are connected. When your vacuum
booster fails, it is a good idea to also check your master cylinder for
signs of fluid leakage. If there is fluid leaking from the master cylinder,
it can be pulled into the Vacuum Brake booster causing damage to the
seals and diaphragm in the Brake Booster.
If the Brake Booster has failed and there is evidence of brake
fluid leaking from the back of the Master Cylinder both the Brake
Booster and the Master Cylinder should be replaced to prevent leaking
brake fluid from damaging the replacement Brake Booster.

Note: When replacing brake components, always flush the entire brake
system with the correct Brake Fluid for the vehicle from a sealed container.
