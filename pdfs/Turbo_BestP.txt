INSTALLATION BEST PRACTICES

VEHICLE PREPARATION


REFER TO VEHICLE SERVICE INFORMATION FOR ANY SPECIAL TESTING,
REMOVAL, OR INSTALLATION PROCEDURES
A)

CHECK FOR ANY RELATED TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS

B)
CHECK FOR AND ADDRESS ANY TURBOCHARGER RELATED DIAGNOSTIC
TROUBLE CODES AND/OR WARNING LIGHTS ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL
C)
REFER TO ANY WARNING TAGS OR TECHNICAL BULLETINS INCLUDED IN THE
BOX WITH THE REPLACEMENT TURBOCHARGER



OBTAIN ALL VEHICLE INFORMATION TO ENSURE CORRECT PART APPLICATION
A)



RUN A THOROUGH ENGINE SYSTEMS DIAGNOSTIC CHECK
A)

B)



MAKE, YEAR, MODEL, ENGINE, TURBOCHARGER SYSTEM DETAILS, ETC.

IN ADDITION, A TURBOCHARGER DIAGNOSTIC CHART CAN BE USEFUL IN
DETERMINING THE ROOT CAUSE OF TURBOCHARGER SYSTEM PROBLEMS BY
SYMPTOM
INSPECT THE VEHICLE PCV SYSTEM. REPAIR AS NECESSARY

CHANGE THE VEHICLE ENGINE OIL, OIL FILTER, AIR FILTER AND FUEL FILTER (IF
EQUIPPED)
NOTE: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CHANGE ANY OF THE SETTINGS OR CALIBRATIONS
OF THE TURBO. DAMAGE MAY OCCUR TO THE TURBO AND/OR ENGINE. IF VNT/
VGT TURBO EQUIPPED, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO MOVE THE ELECTRIC ACTUATOR
ROD MANUALLY BY HAND OR WITH A TOOL. DAMAGE TO THE TURBO WILL
RESULT

Turbo Removal


DISCONNECT AIR INLET AND OUTLET HOSES ON THE COMPRESSOR SIDE OF THE
TURBO. INSPECT ENTIRE BREATHER SYSTEM INCLUDING INTERCOOLER FOR
WEAR AND CONTAMINATES. REPLACE AND/OR CLEAN AS NECESSARY. CAP AIR
INLET AND OUTLET HOSE ENDS TO PREVENT DEBRIS FROM ENTERING SYSTEM
WHILE REPLACING TURBO



DISCONNECT EXHAUST DOWN PIPE ON THE TURBINE SIDE OF THE TURBO.
INSPECT FOR WEAR AND CONTAMINATES. REPLACE AND/OR CLEAN AS
NECESSARY. DISCARD OLD GASKET. NOTE: IF DIESEL EQUIPPED AND ENGINE OIL
HAS CONTAMINATED THE EXHAUST SYSTEM, THE EXHAUST AFTER TREATMENT
SYSTEM (DOC/DPF FILTER SYSTEM) MUST BE CLEANED



DISCONNECT TURBO OIL FEED AND DRAIN LINES. DRAIN COOLANT AND
REMOVE COOLANT LINES (IF APPLICABLE). INSPECT ALL LINES FOR WEAR.
REPLACE AS NECESSARY. DISCARD OLD O-RINGS/GASKETS AND INLET LINE



DEPENDING ON APPLICATION, DISCONNECT THE WASTEGATE ACTUATOR
CONTROL VALVE HOSE OR ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR



REMOVE TURBO MOUNTING HARDWARE AND CAREFULLY REMOVE TURBO
FROM ENGINE. INSPECT EXHAUST MANIFOLD FOR WEAR/CRACKING. REPLACE
AS NECESSARY. DISCARD OLD GASKET



CLOSELY INSPECT THE OLD TURBO TO HELP DETERMINE THE ROOT CAUSE OF
FAILURE

Turbo Installation


CAREFULLY POSITION THE TURBO ONTO EXHAUST MANIFOLD USING THE
CORRECT NEW GASKET. DO NOT USE LIQUID GASKET MAKER OR SEALANTS



USE HIGH TEMPERATURE ANTI-SEIZE COMPOUND ON ALL THREADED
HARDWARE. TORQUE ALL TURBO MOUNTING HARDWARE TO THE CORRECT
SPECIFICATIONS



RECONNECT TURBINE SIDE EXHAUST DOWN PIPE USING THE CORRECT NEW
GASKET



INJECT NEW ENGINE OIL INTO THE OIL INLET PORT OF THE TURBO WITH THE
SYRINGE PROVIDED OR OTHER SUITABLE METHOD. SPIN THE COMPRESSOR
WHEEL BY HAND. IT SHOULD SPIN FREELY. SLIGHT UP AND DOWN MOVEMENT IS
NORMAL



UNCAP AND RECONNECT COMPRESSOR SIDE AIR INLET AND OUTLET HOSES
ENSURING AN AIRTIGHT FIT



DEPENDING ON APPLICATION, RECONNECT WASTEGATE ACTUATOR CONTROL
VALVE HOSE OR ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR



REPLACE TURBO OIL FEED LINE WITH A NEW ONE. CONNECT THE OIL FEED
LINE AND COOLANT LINES (IF APPLICABLE) USING CORRECT NEW GASKETS/ORINGS. FILL ENGINE OIL AND COOLANT (IF APPLICABLE) TO PROPER LEVELS.
NOTE: MAKE SURE OIL FEED LINE, OIL DRAIN LINE AND COOLANT LINES (IF
APPLICABLE) ARE ROUTED PROPERLY. THIS ENSURES UNRESTRICTED OIL
FLOW, COOLANT FLOW AND PREVENTS DAMAGE CAUSED BY EXCESSIVE HEAT
IF LOCATED TOO CLOSE TO EXHAUST SYSTEM



BEFORE CONNECTING THE OIL DRAIN LINE, PUT A CATCH PAN UNDER THE
TURBO. DISABLE THE ENGINE FROM STARTING AND CRANK FOR 15 SECONDS.
LOOK FOR OIL FLOWING OUT OF THE TURBO OIL OUTLET FITTING. REPEAT IF
NECESSARY. THIS WILL PRIME THE OIL FEED LINE AND AVOID LACK OF TURBO
BEARING LUBRICATION. NOTE: TO AVOID STARTER MOTOR DAMAGE, DO NOT
CRANK ENGINE FOR MORE THAN 15 SECONDS AT A TIME WITHOUT LETTING THE
STARTER REST IN BETWEEN CRANK CYCLES



CONNECT THE OIL DRAIN LINE AND ENABLE ENGINE TO START. LET ENGINE
IDLE FOR A MINIMUM OF THREE MINUTES AND INSPECT FOR OIL, AIR AND FUEL
LEAKS. IF VNT/VGT TURBO EQUIPPED, ENSURE ELECTRIC ACTUATOR OPERATES
CORRECTLY. NOTE: IT IS NORMAL FOR THE ELECTRIC ACTUATOR TO HAVE
MOVEMENT AT KEY ON AND ENGINE RUNNING. IF NO MOVEMENT IS DETECTED,
TURN OFF ENGINE IMMEDIATELY AND CORRECT THE ISSUE



AFTER COMPLETING ALL THE POST TURBO INSTALLATION INSPECTIONS, TURN
OFF ENGINE AND ALLOW TO COOL. CHECK ENGINE OIL AND COOLANT LEVELS
(IF APPLICABLE). FILL AS NEEDED. TEST DRIVE VEHICLE TO VERIFY PROPER
TURBO AND ENGINE PERFORMANCE
