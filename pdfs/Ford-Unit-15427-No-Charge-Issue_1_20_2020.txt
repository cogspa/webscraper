When dealing with electrical issues, make sure you perform a
proper diagnosis to locate the underlying cause.
When you run into a no charge issue on an 05-06 Ford
Expedition, the problem may be with the alternator’s regulator
connector. The alternator sends a signal through the wiring harness
to the PCM so the PCM can determine the vehicle’s electrical load
to maintain the proper voltage set point. The PCM also uses this
signal to determine the load placed on the engine by the charging
system. If there is an issue with the wiring harness, the alternator’s
signal cannot reach the PCM and could cause a no charge issue.
The PCM controls the alternator regulator through the
Regulator Connector terminal/wire. The PCM sends a command signal
to the regulator, indicating the desired voltage setpoint needed.

To test this system, first, disconnect the three-terminal
connector. Use a wiring schematic to identify the AS =SENSE, RC =GENCOM, and LI = GEN-MON circuits. With the ignition key on, engine off, and the
alternator connector disconnected, your SENSE wire should have battery
voltage at the connector. Next, the GEN-COM wire should have zero volts, and
the GEN-MON wire should have approximately 9 - 12 volts at the connector.
