Belt

Noises during startup in cold weather could be as simple as a belt or tensioner.
The 2015 Chrysler 200 with a 3.6L V6 and the 2014 - 2015
Jeep Cherokee with a 3.2L V6 may experience a 20-90 second,
high frequency “squealing” noise on startup. These noise events
occur on cold starts where ambient temperatures are relatively
low (~32F). The belt tensioner on these vehicles is a common
failure point and can cause noise events under certain conditions.
Replacement of the belt tensioner (OE Part Number 04627533AC)
and drive belt could eliminate the problem. Component inspection
and diagnosis will determine the actual source of the problem.
