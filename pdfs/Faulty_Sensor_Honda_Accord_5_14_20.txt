Cause:
Could be due to an improperly manufactured battery sensors.
The Solution:
Replacement of the faulty battery management sensor.

Vehicles that received the temporary repair are being recalled again,
to receive a replacement battery sensor.
Improperly manufactured battery sensors could allow conductive moisture to
enter into the battery management sensor (i.e., road salts, etc.). This moisture
could result in an electrical short and under-hood fire.
Previously affected vehicles were recalled through a Safety Recall for a
temporary repair. Vehicles that received the temporary repair are being
recalled again, to receive a replacement battery sensor.

Some alternator part numbers may be improperly diagnosed as defective and
then returned for replacement, or in some cases, claims for vehicle thermal
event damage may be filed, when in fact, the OE battery management sensor
is faulty, and the root cause for the charging system failure.
Please reference Honda Tech Bulletin TSB 17-069 for more information

All Honda customers, especially used car or private party customers, may
not have received a notice of the Honda recall for the battery management
sensor, and this may adversely affect aftermarket alternator warranty returns.
