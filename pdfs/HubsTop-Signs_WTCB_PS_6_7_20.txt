What are the signs that you need to replace
your wheel bearings or wheel hub assemblies?
Symptoms:
Clicking, popping, snapping, grinding, roaring or humming
noises.
Cause:
The hub has lost lubrication or is worn out.
The Solution:
The hub needs to be replaced.

Damaged wheel bearings may break entirely and possibly
lead to serious accidents if not replaced.
Have you had any of these questions?
• Where is the grinding noise I hear coming from?
(I checked my brakes and they look good.)
• What is causing this vibration in my steering wheel?
• Why is there so much play in my steering wheel when I turn?

If you experience any of the above mentioned symptoms be sure to have
your vehicle inspected as soon as possible.
Every wheel on your vehicle is attached to a hub. Inside the hub is a set
of lubricated wheel bearings that lets your tires and wheels spin freely
without getting too hot. Wheel bearings are engineered to last for a long
time. However, eventually they will lose their lubrication, wear out, or
just get old.

If your wheel bearing breaks, it can cause a wheel to fall off your car
while in motion and possibly lead to a very serious accident.
Make sure your customers observe the following procedures when
installing wheel hub bearings and or wheel hub assemblies:
• Always follow the vehicle manufactures torque specifications for hub
bearing mounting bolts, axle nuts, and wheel lug nuts.
• Never use an impact gun during installation.
• Use thread locking compound on the hub bearing mounting bolts if
specified by the vehicle manufacture.
• On vehicles equipped with Anti-Lock Brakes (ABS), when replacing a
wheel hub bearing or wheel hub assembly, you may need to clear any
stored ABS fault codes.
