WARNING: Oil contamination of your replacement starter may void your
warranty. Before you install a replacement starter, check your vehicle for
oil leaks.
If your 2001- 2004 Nissan Xterra or Frontier with a 3.3L V-6 engine is suffering
from a failed starter, it may be caused by a leaking valve cover gasket seal.
These vehicles are known for valve cover gasket leaks. The passenger side leak
will run down the back of the engine, enter the starter and severely shorten its
lifespan.
Oil leaking into the starter will eventually destroy the brushes and the armature
causing premature failure of the starter. To address this problem of leaking oil,
the valve cover gasket will need to be replaced.
Replacing the valve cover gasket is an inexpensive and easy fix to help prevent
future starter failure.
