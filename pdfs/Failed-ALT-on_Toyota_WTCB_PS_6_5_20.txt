Application: 1997-2001 Toyota Vehicles
with 4 cylinder and V6 engines

Cause:
A corroded or damaged battery cable.
The Solution:
Replace the alternator and corroded or damaged
battery cable.
Failed Alternator

Over time, the corroded battery cable can cause an
alternator to fail and need to be replaced.
If your 1997 - 2001 Toyota vehicle with a 4, or V-6 engine is suffering from one or
more of the symptoms listed above, it may be caused by a corroded or damaged
battery cable. Corroded or damaged battery cables can cause alternator failure
and requires replacement.
Remove the failed alternator from the vehicle; if there is evidence of corrosion
on the negative battery cable, it requires replacement along with the failed
alternator. Carefully inspect under the battery tray for corrosion; this is where
the negative battery cable connects to the vehicle chassis on some Toyota
vehicles.
On these vehicles, it is also essential to properly test and make sure the battery
is completely charged when replacing the alternator. A discharged or defective
battery can cause premature failure of the replacement alternator.
